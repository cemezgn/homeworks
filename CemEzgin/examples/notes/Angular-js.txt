Single Page Application (SPA)
Inside of angular.js you can use a lite version of jquery with "jqLite"

The best problem is the frontend is the late page loading when the page open.
With the angular we can split the pages ýnto small pieces and we can combine it in a page.
without View its not usefull. - Test writings writes with angular.js

For every module we need a scope and we are combining this scopes in a root scope.
