1) Kernel
There are 2 kernel types:
- Monolithic kernels (such as Linux)
- Microkernel 


Kernel elements:
- Processes
	
- Interrupts
- Modes
- Memory Management
- Multi-tasking
- Disk access and file systems
- Device drivers
- System calls (such as 'open', 'alloc', 'malloc' in C programming language)

'ps' shows us the processes in the system.
