Components of Operation Systems:

Kernel
Networking
Security



1) Kernel
=========
There are 2 kernel types:
- Monolithic kernels (such as Linux)
- Microkernel 


Kernel elements:
- Processes
	Threads - creates abstraction.
	
- Interrupt
- Modes
	User mode
	Supervisor mode
- Memory Management
	Segmentation
	Paging
	Virtual memory
	Page fault
- Multi-tasking
- Disk access and file systems
- Device drivers
- System calls (such as 'open', 'alloc', 'malloc' in C programming language)

'ps' shows us the processes in the system.


2) Networking
=============


3) Security
===========

4) User Iterface
================
- Shell
	Bash: The GNU shell
	GCC: The GNU C Compile
	GDB: The GNU Debugger
	Coreutils
	Findutils
	GNOME
	Emacs
	
	
	
	
Shell commands:
==============
'at' - lets you write the program which will be used later
'cronetab' - show the instructions will be run in future
'ps' 
'ps ef' 

'ls /etc/rc0.d' 
'ls -l /etc/rc0.d'
'ls *' - lists all of the files.	
'man at' - info about the "at" command
'info bash' - info about the "bash" command

GNU Bash and commands:
======================



Linux Containers:
================


HW: Using containers, understanding Docker.
HW: Interactive Rebase, split a commit.

SOME TOOLS:
git reflog
git stash
git clean
git grep
