Components of Operation Systems:

Kernel
Networking
Security



1) Kernel
There are 2 kernel types:
- Monolithic kernels (such as Linux)
- Microkernel 


Kernel elements:
- Processes
	Threads - creates abstraction.
- Interrupt
- Modes
	User mode
	Supervisor mode
- Memory Management
	Segmentation
	Paging
	Virtual memory
	Page fault
- Multi-tasking
	
- Disk access and file systems
- Device drivers
- System calls (such as 'open', 'alloc', 'malloc' in C programming language)

'ps' shows us the processes in the system.
